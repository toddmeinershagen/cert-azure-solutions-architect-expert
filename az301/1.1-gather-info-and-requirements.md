1. Availability
	* How many days per week?  How many hours per day?
    * Typically there is downtime
    * Are the consequences dire for downtime?
    * SLA - service level agreement - just state it
    * Azure Support
		* Each service they offer has an SLA (ex - single VM:  99.9%)
		* It's a financial guarantee
		* Options
			* Availability Set - requires a load balancer or application gateway
			* Availability Zones
			* Load Balancers
			* Fallback Options - replicated DBs for instance; manual or automatic fallback
            * Traffic Manager
        * Principles
            * Design for no single point of failure - plug weak link with redundancy
1. Capacity planning and scalability
	* Need to understand how intensely the application will be used (# of users, # of transactions, etc.)
	* Have a plan for how you will scale up for unexpected demand
	* Azure Options
		* IaaS
			* Azure Site Recovery Capacity Planner - spreadsheet that will help forecast capacity needs
			* Azure Migrate - discovers and assesses needs for lifting and shifting an existing on-premise system
			* Load Balancers - distributes traffic across VMs that you can continue adding
			* VM Scale Sets - VMs, load balancers, with auto scalability rules
			* Azure Batch - break up a huge task into small jobs to scale up and do a lot of work in parallel
		* PaaS
			* Manual and automatic scaling
2. Deploy-ability
	* Ability to go from dev into testing and production with low effort; includes rollbacks if problem happens
	* Azure Support
		* Publish from Visual Studio to Azure (deployment slots)
		* Azure DevOps - Pipelines - CI/CD with Github and others
1. Configurability
	* Ability to support different configurations by environment and the ability to accept changes without a re-deploy
	* Azure Support
		* PaaS - set up application variables in Azure (environment variables)
		* PaaS - deployment slots with their own variables (environment variables)
		* Key Vault - secrets, keys, and certificates
1. Governance
	* A control mechanism to ensure only authorized changes are made, changes are documented, and everything is transparent
	* Could include code reviews, secondary approvals, testing having to pass
	* Azure Support
		* Azure Policy - only certain types of resources can be created or only in certain resource groups
		* RBAC - can control different levels of access to resources
		* Azure Pipelines - can authorize people to do certain things or adding a level of approvals
1. Maintainability
	* Ability for an application be maintained by people other than the original developer, and the ability to find, discover and fix bugs in a timely fashion
	* Azure Support
		* Diagnostics - can extract log files from hosts for various resources
		* HDInsights - write code to expose data into HDInsights which can then be queried
		* Azure Monitor - dashboard where all of your resources can be ingested into a workspace and you can query across these diagnostic logs or HDInsights logs
1. Security
	* Includes authentication, authorization, preventing, detecting, and protecting from attacks
	* Azure Support
		* Azure Active Directory - identity as a service, passwords, MFA, detection
		* RBAC - role-based access control; principle of least privilege - only give people the least privilege they need to do their jobs
	    * Azure Advisor - can provide alerts on security guidanc        e
	    * Azure Security Center - central dashboard for the security of yo      ur solutions
        * API Management - limit calls with throttling and securing only to recogne clients (Oauth)
1. Sizing
	* Prediction of how much resources a system will need to run and how those resources are optimized over time to minimize cost while maintaining performance
	* Azure Support
		* Azure Monitor - allows you to know if VM or PaaS services are pushing the limits of those resources (CPU%, Memory, etc.)
		* Cloudyn - monitors Azure Account and Google/AWS accounts to analyze your usage and make recommendations
		* Cost Center - optimization tools to help you see which resource groups are spending the most
		* Azure Advisor - cost optimization guidance that is increasing over time
		* Reserved Instances - VMs for 1 or 3 years for instance instead of paying by the hour; up to a 50% cost savings
		* Hybrid Benefit for Windows and SQL Server - reduces the cost for licensing; bring your own license for SQL Server (could bring 80% cost savings)
		* Dev/Test licensing - not all product/resources; lower environments can save money
		* Auto-scale - if tuned well it can optimize your use of resources
		* Serverless Microservices - Functions or Service Fabric or Containerization - consumption based pricing
1. Change Request
    * How a company handles change requests
	* Waterfall, Agile, DevOps (Kanban?) - different process types
	* TOGAF - change management 
	* ITIL Standard
