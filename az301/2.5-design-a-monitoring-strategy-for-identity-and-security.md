1. Monitoring Identity
    * Alert notifications
    * Azure AD PIM (privileged identity management) has an alert feature
        * Pre-defined set of alerts that you can use
        * You can customize values that trigger the alerts
        * Example - Admins not using their privileged roles within a certain # of days
    * Identity is the front door of your house - so focus on protecting and monitoring it
        * On-premise AD is the first point of entry
            * AD Connect - get reports on sync; keep up on the health of the sync
            * Log Analytics - run reports on who is getting access or denied access
        * Patching, anti-virus, firewall, etc. - on all hosts on-premise
        * Use policies to keep these servers up to date with patches to ensure no cracks
