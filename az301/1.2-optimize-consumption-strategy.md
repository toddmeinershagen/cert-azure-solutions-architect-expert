1. Challenges
    * Cloud computing has an increasing cost over time due to entropy
        * Entropy - a gradual decline into disorder
	* How does entropy grow?
        * Use of storage grows over time
	    * Never decommission old apps
1. Options for Prediction and Management of Costs
	* Pricing Calculator
        * Calculatore allows you to compare the costs of two options over a period of time
        * MS Learn has a good module on the pricing calculator
	* Refactor/Re-architect
        * Instead of shift and lift you might want to move closer to cloud native (using microservices, for example)
	    * Generally, FaaS (Serverless) and PaaS are cheaper than IaaS
	* Azure Advisor
		* Makes recommendations for how to optimize costs
	* Azure Cost Management
		* Only with Enterprise agreement
		* Shows trends from history of spending/reports/etc.
1. Other Options for Managing Costs
	* Cloudyn - more advanced reporting on usage of cloud; can handle multiple cloud types
	* Reserved Instances - up to 72% in savings
	* Hybrid Benefit - up to 80% in savings
	* Right size your resources by selecting the appropriate size - not the default
    * Auto-Scaling
	* Resource Groups - allow you to group and organize for analyzing costs
	* Subscriptions - another form of grouping  for cost management
	* Tagging - if resources for different cost centers are in the same resource group to establish ownership
    * Environmental cleanup chore - could have a periodic activity like a refrigerator cleaning that says that anything that hasn't been touched or is not on an officially approved list will be deleted by some date unless someone says something
