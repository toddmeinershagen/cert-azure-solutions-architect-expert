1. Azure Active Directory
    * Doesn't replace Windows Active Directory - this is a cloud service - Identity as a Service
    * Starting a brand new AD account creates a new portal account (new dashboard/no resources)
    * Azure AD Connect - allows for SSO with on-premise AD identities
    * Custom Domain Names - allows you to add managed domains to your directory
        * Out of the box you can only maintain the xxx.onmicrosoft.com domain
        * Must add a custom domain and verify by adding a txt and mx record to your domain
    * Adding Users
        * Add a domain User (member) - these are added to your directory as a guest
        * Add a guest User (guest) - you can invite this person to our directory
    * Self-service Password Reset
        * Requires a premium P2 (office 365) or enterprise account - not free
        * Trial lasts for 30 days
        * Authentication Methods - you can choose how they can reset - phone, email, text, etc. (requires some registration to gather additional info for reset)
        * Registration - forcing users to register for self-service password reset
        * Notifications - you can tell it to notify the user and admins when a reset happens
        * On-Prem Integration - do you want it to sync the password change back to on-premise
1. Authentication
    * Unquestionable proof that you are who you say you are - authenticate yourself
        * User Id/Password - something you KNOW
        * Multi-Factor Authentication - email, text, rsa fob, fingerprint, etc. - something you HAVE
        * Federation - we can delegate trust to another authority to authenticate this person
            * Validate a token that you are given has integrity
    * Using Azure to do this makes things easier to maintain instead of building your own identity store
        * It can sync with corporate AD - latency of a few minutes, allows for revoking access as well
        * Multi-factor authentication
        * RBAC
        * Social media account sync and/or federation
    * Security
        * IPSec - security at the IP layer (network stack)
            * Encrypt data packets (TLS/SSL)
            * Authentication Header - signing the packet - authenticate the origin of the packet
            * Usually for VPNs
        * MFA - multi-factor authentication
            * Allows more sophisticated ways of proving a user is who they say they are
1.  Authorization
    * What level of access do you have?
    * How fine grained is that access?  (roles, privileges, scope)
