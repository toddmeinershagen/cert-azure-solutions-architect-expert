* Now that we know who you are, what can you do?
* Could be a person or an application (service account)
    * Application can either do things on your back
    * Background applications may need to do things regardless of your identity

1. Two types of authorization
    * Role-based
        * A user that is part of a set of roles that allows you to do certain tasks
    * Claims-based
        * You are in possession of a token/key that gives you permission to call an API
    * You can enforce at the front door or at the more granular level like locked drawers in a house
1.  Approach
    * Need to understand your needs to decide how granular you need to go with locking things
    * Think of a hotel that needs to have closets and each room locked to protect the guests
    * Delegation - is the application running under its own name or is it running on behalf of an individual?
    * Azure AD
        * Register applications - delegate the authentication to Azure AD
        * You can manage roles
        * Azure AD Conditional Access
            * enforce MFA if risk level is deemed above the threshold (maybe different IP or outside the country, etc.)
            * Could be just a basic limit of access if you are not following normal parameters and your manager could get you access, if needed
        * Azure Key Vault
            * Delegate secret holding to remove secrets from code and configuration
            * Authorize specific applications to be able to access these secrets
            * Principle of least privilege
            * Avoid reinventing the wheel - can be substandard
1. Access Permissions
    * Groups
        * A way to organize Users in a category
        * The group can be granted access to resources/applications
        * The Premium version of Azure AD supports dynamic groups that can be based on criteria so that Users dynamically grow as they are added based on attributes
        * You can assign individuals as a Group Owner to allow them to assign Users to a group (User Administrator)
    * Roles
        * Built-In Roles for Resources
            * Owner - full access to the resource and can assign permissions to that resource to other Users
            * Contributor - can control a resource but cannot assign to others
            * Reader - can see resource, but you cannot modify or control that resource
        * Custom Roles
            * Requires Azure Premium account to create custom roles
            * You assign permissions to that Role
